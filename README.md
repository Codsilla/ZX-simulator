# ZX-simulator
Classical simulator of quantum computing with stabilser decompositions through ZX-calculus.
This is a re-implementation of the simulator of [quizx](https://github.com/Quantomatic/quizx) but now including graphs cuts (using KaHyPar hypergraph partionning libray).

This is a quick and dirty implementation as it was develop as I was experimenting.

As of now the fastest decomposition function is `decomp_most_connected_cat` with `imbalence` set as 0.5.
